              <p>
                I have been a musician almost all of my life. I found that while
                touring I seemed to have SO MUCH downtime day-to-day. I was
                introduced to the world of coding by a family member in 2019 and
                I haven't stopped learning since!
              </p>

              <p>
                I am excited to dive deeper into programming professionally.
                Being a musician I am almost always working & collaborating with
                others, and I look forward to doing the same in a development
                atmosphere! I already have friends who are excited for me to
                graduate so I can get working on their websites! In addition to
                building websites, I want to help develop custom apps & web
                features my clients can implement to help maximize efficiency &
                problem solve on-the-fly.

                  Food On Tour was created by a musician for other touring
                  musicians. I wanted to create a simple one-stop hub for great
                  food to find around the world while on tour. Users can create
                  a profile, begin sharing their recommendations, build up a
                  bucket list, and check out other users' profiles with all of
                  their go-to's as well. Here is the

                  >
                    live app</a
                  >
                  for you to try out. And here is the
                  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Kevin-Conroy/food-on-tour-client">Github repo</a
                  >. The client was build using React, Javascript, HTML, and
                  CSS. The API was built using Express, Node, PostgreSQL.

            <h3>Practice Pal</h3>

           </div>
            <p>I created practice pal for people like me who sometimes get a bit 
			   too busy to keep track of the smaller details in life. Practice Pal
			   is an app that allows drummers or guitar players to build up a list 
			   of exercises to practice and keep close track of their 
			   progress along the way. Here is the  <a href="https://practice-pal-client-kevin-conroy.vercel.app/">
               live link</a> and here is the
              <a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Conroy/Practice-Pal-Client">Github repo.</a> The client was build using 
			  React, Javascript, HTML, and
			  CSS. The API was built using Express, Node, PostgreSQL.

              <img src="images/IMG_8988.jpg" alt="Noteful" />
           </div>
            <p>Noteful is an aptly named application. Users can build up various titled folders,
              and place relevant notes in each folder. It has replaced the pencil & post-it note 
              I usually carry to the grocery store, and has made life a lot easier (and my pockets a little roomier!)

              <a href="https://noteful-client-khaki.vercel.app/">link</a> to try it out
              for yourself! The client was built with React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
